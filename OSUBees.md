## Reason for this project:

- We hope that this project will help students plan their future better. The topic of this competition is student better life, and we hope that this project will help students to reduce their academic stress. Through this project, we hope to reduce students' academic stress and use this tool to allow them to communicate with others around them about interesting courses. They can also exchange class schedules to meet people who are taking the same classes.
